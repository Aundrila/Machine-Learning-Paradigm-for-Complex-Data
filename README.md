# Machine-Learning-Paradigm-for-Complex-Data

This notebook explores the curse of dimensionality, a fundamental challenge in machine learning where high-dimensional data negatively impacts model performance. The analysis demonstrates how increasing the number of dimensions affects data distribution, distance metrics, and model efficiency. By visualizing these effects, we highlight the need for dimensionality reduction techniques to improve learning efficiency.

## Objectives
- Understand how distances between points behave in high-dimensional space.
- Visualize the impact of increasing dimensions on data sparsity.
- Demonstrate why machine learning models struggle in high-dimensional settings.
- Explore possible solutions like PCA, LDA, and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
